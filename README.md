# HabitatPower

An open-source platform enabling the simulation of energy-use technics in application of buildings under specific climate conditions.
In the future, users could upload their solution on any engineering cases and challenge with each other on various aspects.

## Background story

Recently I've been assigned to work with the Shanghai Metro Group on their project aiming to reduce the daily consumption 
of the subway stations energy systems. The focus of my participation is to optimize the the air-conditioning systems parameters 
as well as the lightning operations in public area.
It would recommend some reasonable combinations of complex physics modeling and AI methodologies, 
as well as virtual environment in which solutions could be simulated and compared with each other: 
And that's how came the idea of developing along the way, a whole new industrial simulation platform that would be easy to use, 
esthetically appreciable and competitive among users.

Why not use existing app such as EnergyPlus or TRNSYS? First of all, 
I always found that it is highly inconvenient to implement complex solutions on their user interface. Secondly, 
when navigating academia papers or enterprises conferences on the field of energy system, 
people have absolutely no idea on who has the best software or algorithm solutions, 
in other word, there is not yet any reliable and fair referee platform which could neutrally judge who is the best. And as a matter of fact, 
I believe engineering should be openly competitive like a sport game; may the best win.

Thats how I'm beginning the HabitatPower App, an open-source platform enabling the simulation of energy-use technics in application of 
buildings under specific climate conditions.
In the future, users could upload their solution on any engineering cases and challenge with each other on various aspects.
