# HabitatPower

The next-generation open-source platform enabling the design, simulation and optimization of energy system

## Current Main Functions

Open the Integrated App Demo or naviguate through the 'demo_app_v1.x' folders to experience in advance the new prototype of energy system simulation platform with the terminal command ""

## Newest Features

22/10/31 - v1.3 update, featuring four main functionalities


## Accumulations

22/08/03 - Uploading the models and research notes essentially for some typical refrigeration system components as well as the ipynb test field for the Shanghai Metro Station cases

22/08/11 - Now in the 'demo_app_v1.1' users could create and define their own air-conditioning systems and adjust various parameters within extendable pannels

22/08/26 - v1.2 update

22/10/31 - v1.3 update, featuring four main functionalities in four modules

## Background story

Recently I've been assigned to work with the Shanghai Metro Group on their project aiming to reduce the daily consumption 
of the subway stations energy systems. The focus of my participation is to optimize the the air-conditioning systems parameters 
as well as the lightning operations in public area.
It would recommend some reasonable combinations of complex physics modeling and AI methodologies, 
as well as virtual environment in which solutions could be simulated and compared with each other: 
And that's how came the idea of developing along the way, a whole new industrial simulation platform that would be easy to use, 
esthetically appreciable and competitive among users.

Why not use existing app such as EnergyPlus or TRNSYS? First of all, 
I always found that it is highly inconvenient to implement complex solutions on their user interface. Secondly, 
when navigating academia papers or enterprises conferences on the field of energy system, 
people have absolutely no idea on who has the best software or algorithm solutions, 
in other word, there is not yet any reliable and fair referee platform which could neutrally judge who is the best. And as a matter of fact, 
I believe engineering should be openly competitive like a sport game; may the best win.

Thats how I'm beginning the HabitatPower App, an open-source platform enabling the simulation of energy-use technics in application of 
buildings under specific climate conditions.
In the future, users could upload their solution on any engineering cases and challenge with each other on various aspects.
